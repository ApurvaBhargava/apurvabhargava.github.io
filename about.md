title: "About me"
subtitle: "From deterministic algorithms to uncertain worlds and structured reasoning."

I started out fascinated by clean, deterministic algorithms and tidy correctness proofs. Over time, I realized that
most of the problems I care about live in uncertain, partially observed, and often messy environments. That curiosity
led me towards probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and eventually questions around <strong>reasoning</strong> and
<strong>representation</strong>.

Today, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer, building production systems for document intelligence and fraud detection.
On the research side, I am especially interested in models that separate <em>world representation</em> from
<em>decision‑making</em>:

- Energy‑based models (EBMs) over structured objects (arguments, states, trajectories)  
- Joint embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs) that learn latent spaces instead of token‑by‑token next‑step prediction  
- Model‑predictive‑control‑style (MPC) mechanisms that plan in latent space  

I enjoy thinking about questions like:

- How can we give models <em>control knobs</em> over the factors that matter in a task?  
- How do we align latent spaces with controllable, interpretable variables?  
- Where do current LLMs and world models genuinely fail at multi‑step reasoning or strategic behavior?

Beyond work and research, I write to clarify my thinking—often about representation learning, AGI‑adjacent ideas, and
the gap between “looking smart on benchmarks” and actually solving robust, real‑world problems.
