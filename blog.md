title: "Substack & writing"
subtitle: "Thinking in public about reasoning, representation learning, and AGI‑adjacent ideas."

I use writing as a way to clarify my own thinking. Some themes that show up often:

- The difference between <em>looking</em> intelligent on benchmarks and actually solving robust, real‑world problems  
- Why separating world models from decision policies matters for AGI  
- Where current LLMs struggle with multi‑step reasoning, strategy, and control  

### Substack

You can find my long‑form posts on Substack:

- <strong>DepthNote</strong> – on JEPA, EBMs, MPC, and AGI‑inspired architectures  
  <em>(Insert your actual Substack link here.)</em>

- Shorter pieces on generative models (GANs, diffusion, EBMs) and lessons from production ML systems  
  <em>(Additional Substack or blog links.)</em>

### Other writing

- Technical notes and experiments on
  <a href="https://github.com/ApurvaBhargava" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>  
- Occasional reflections on learning, research, and career paths in ML

As the volume of posts grows, this page can evolve into a proper index of articles by theme (reasoning, generative
models, systems, etc.).
