## Research‑flavored projects

### Energy‑Based Abstract Argumentation
An experimental framework where each configuration of accepted/rejected arguments in an argumentation graph is assigned
an energy. Low‑energy configurations correspond to “reasonable” sets of beliefs, allowing for soft, graded acceptance
instead of brittle semantics. This is especially interesting for noisy text‑derived argument graphs.

- Focus: EBMs, structured prediction, argumentation  
- Status: Prototype design, dataset curation, and modeling ideas in progress

---

### JEPA‑Style World Model with MPC‑like Control
Toy experiments in small grid‑worlds where a JEPA learns a latent representation of the environment, and a simple
planning loop searches over latent futures to reach a goal (e.g., a key, a door). The aim is to tease apart “world
understanding” from “policy” and test ideas about factored latent spaces.

- Focus: JEPA, disentanglement, model predictive control  
- Status: Early‑stage; ideal for scaling into a PhD‑level project

## Applied / systems projects

### Document Fraud Detection in Production
Siamese and metric‑learning based models trained on examples of “good” vs “suspicious” document fonts and layouts to
flag anomalous paystubs and bank statements. Integrated with rule‑based checks and human review pipelines.

- Focus: Representation learning, anomaly detection, MLOps  
- Status: Deployed and iterated in industry

---

### Food Aid Optimization System
A three‑component system for social good: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and vehicle routing, designed to
support organizations delivering meals to elderly, disabled, and low‑income populations.

- Focus: Forecasting, prescriptive analytics, routing algorithms  
- Status: Conceptual + analytical prototype
